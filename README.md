Observations: 

1. With the data samples obtained, there is a clear understanding that the further out from the equator, the lower the temperatures are. As you get closer, you see it becomes warmer. On the Northern hemisphere, you can see temperatures drop under 30 degrees, where as on the Southern hemisphere, the lowest point is about 30 degrees.

2. There is no correlation between any of the other scatterplots. The wind does not tend to get abouve 20 mph, although there are some outliers. The cloudiness is heavy on both low percent and high percent, but in the middle there are less samples in the area between 20-60% cloudiness.

3. Most areas seem to be humid. There are a bit more on the Northen hemisphere, but the sample generally show high humidity across the board.
